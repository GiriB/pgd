**********************************************
Technologies Used By Protein Geometry Database
**********************************************

==================
Macro technologies
==================

These technologies are the large building blocks about which the
software is designed.

Updating this software is usually a long, involved process, so no
attempt at documenting this process will be included here.

----------
Django 1.6
----------

Homepage
    https://www.djangoproject.com/
Latest Release
    https://github.com/django/django/releases

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
development and clean, pragmatic design. Django provides some of the
following features that are useful to PGD:

    * Object Relational Mapping (ORM) - maps python classes to SQL
      tables, including a comprehensive query engine.
    * Form API for validation of user input
    * Templating system for layout of presentation

---------
MySQL 5.5
---------

Homepage
    https://www.mysql.com/
Latest Release
    http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

MySQL is "the world's most popular open source database".

==================
Micro technologies
==================

These technologies are just as important but are smaller and usually
easier to update and/or replace.  The Javascript tools may be
updated by using the following process (using jquery as an example):

#. Check out a copy of the PGD from Github and create a new branch.

   ::

      $ git clone https://github.com/osuosl/pgd.git
      $ (cd pgd && git checkout develop && git checkout -b update-jquery)

#. Retrieve the latest release.

   ::

      $ wget https://github.com/jquery/jquery/archive/1.11.3.tar.gz


#. Extract the `jquery.min.js` and `jquery.min.map` files and put them
   in the correct location.

   .. note: Not all packages include a map file!

   ::

      $ tar zxf 1.11.3.tar.gz
      $ cp jquery-1.11.3/dist/jquery.min.* pgd/pgd_core/static/js/

   If the filenames have changed, perhaps because the version number
   is included in the filename: 

   #. use `git grep` on the PGD source tree to find all references to
      the old version.  Replace these references with references to
      the new version.  Use `git add` to stage these files for a
      commit.

   #. Use `git rm` to remove the old file, and `git add` to add the
      new file.

#. Spin up an instance, perform a search, and look at the plot to make
   sure the text still looks right.

#. Use `git commit` to commit your changes to your local repository.
   Your commit message should include the new version as well as any
   changes or differences noted during testing.

#. Use `git push` to push your changes to Github.  Finally, submit a
   pull request based on this branch.

simplifying things or making them work better.

jQuery UI 1.11.4
--------------------------

Homepage
    http://jqueryui.com/
Latest Releases
    http://jqueryui.com/download/

This plugin provides a comprehensive set of user interface widgets,
including autocomplete.  It will replace the existing autocomplete
Javascript and CSS.  It may also replace the tooltips.

Select the `Stable` link under `Quick downloads` on the
latest-releases page.  In addition to copying the `jquery-ui.min.js`
into place, also copy the `jquery-ui.min.css` file into the
appropriate directory for CSS files.

jQuery Browser 0.0.7
--------------------

Homepage
    https://github.com/gabceb/jquery-browser-plugin
Latest Release
    https://github.com/gabceb/jquery-browser-plugin/releases

jQuery stopped supporting browser detection in 1.9, so the
functionality is available via a separate plugin.

Alternatively, this functionality may be replaced with feature checks
instead of browser checks.  Have to wait and see!
